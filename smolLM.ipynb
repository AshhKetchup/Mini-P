            "\n",
            "15. **Paintbrush**:\n",
            "    - Rationales: A paintbrush can be used to dab lightly at the fire to cool it down slightly, reducing the risk of burning the potato.\n",
            "    - Visual Features: Flexible bristles, soft rubber handle, small size.\n",
            "\n",
            "16. **Wrench**:\n",
